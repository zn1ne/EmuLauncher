0.  Introduction
****************************************************************************

ePSXe is a Sony Playstation emulator for your PC running under 
Win9x/2k/xp or linux.  It takes advantage of the popular PSEmu Pro 
plugin system.

****************************************************************************
1.  What's New?
****************************************************************************

ePSXe v1.7.0, released on 24.05.2008

- Multiple changes has been done in the Pad support. This version supports
  the Axis LRX, axis with +/-/full ranges, and a important bug in vibration
  support has been fixed avoiding crashes. In the sio emulation section,
  this version includes better DualShock protocol support, including
  vibration in more games, and adding 2 new pad types, "DualAnalog" and
  "Negcon". Finally thanks to the new Pete's gpu plugins, a new type of
  "visual vibration" has been included, shaking the image when the
  game triggers a vibration effect. (Note: if you are using epsxe 1.6.0
  or older, it could be necessary to reconfigure the pad plugin in this
  new version).

- The internal SPU plugin has been updated to the 1.7.0 version. This
  version includes new effects like better envelope, noise, interpolation,
  frequency modulation, reverb and better synchronization between the core
  and the sound. Thanks to this last fix, the following games work better now:
  Metal Gear Solid, Valkyrie Profile, Eithea. Besides the spu API now
  includes support for CDDA playing, getting better CDDA sound and core
  synchronization, and compatibility with Vib Ribbon.

- In this new version, the iso support code has been rewritten. Now it supports
  the formats BIN/CUE, BIN/CCD and MDS/MDF (and minor fixes to ISO/NRG
  support). Besides, due to the changes in the internal spu plugin, now
  the CDDA sound is supported even when you run a iso game.
  Advice!!!: The files BIN/CUE, BIN/CCD must have the same name and
  different extension or the games will not be loaded

- The MDEC decoder has been rewritten in the new version to get
  new games playable suach as Area 51, Novastorm, Eggs of Steel 
  and Maximum Force. It also fixes other minor bugs in other games 
  like Rayman and Metal Gear Solid SM.

- In 1.7.0, thanks to Pete's help and his gpu plugins, the framelimit 
  management has been changed. Now the framelimit is always
  enabled on startup and it can be toggled on/off with the F4 key.
  It is recommended that you update your GPU plugins to the
  version that will be released around the epsxe release date.

- In this new version, a new version of the Pete's Software Plugin is
  included in the plugins directory with the name "gpu.data. With the
  F7 key it is possible change on the fly between the selected gpu
  plugin and that gpu soft plugin. The software plugin "gpu.dat" can
  be configured in the GPU plugin configuration screen with the 3
  bottom buttons.

- The XA/CDDA support has been worked in this new version, fixing sound
  problems in the following games: Gamera 2000, The Putter Golf, Silverload,
  The Firemen 2 Pete & Danny, Iron & Blood - Warriors of Ravenloft,
  Chronicles of the Sword.

- Fixes to the CD-Rom decoder and the core, which made at least 50 more games
  playable like, for example, Brigandine, Need for Speed 1, Harry Potter I&II, 
  Danger Girl, Wacky Races, Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor, Shadow Madness,
  London Seirei Tantei-Dan, Monsters SA, Equestrian Showcase, Black Down,
  Paca Paca Passion 1/2/special, This is football 2, Formula 1 EA 2000,
  Winnie the Pooh, Formula one 99/2000/2001/arcade, Gegere No Kitarou,
  Konohana - True Report, Yukyu Gensokyoku 3 - Perpetual Blue, 
  Tama - Adventurous Ball In Giddy Labyrinth, Future Cop LAP, Virus 2000,
  Spot goes to Hollywood, Pop'n music disney Tunes, Cosmic Race,
  Super Gals Kotubiran, Koran Karon, WWF in your house, Tales of Fandom,
  Transformers best of wars, Simple 1500 vol57 - the maze, Initial D,
  Jounetsu Nekketsu Athletes, Rise of Robots 2: Resurrecion,
  Tora Tora Tora, Victory Boxing Championship Edition, Final Fantasy 4,
  Vampire Hunter D and otros.

- Note: for information about compatibility and games's configuration,
  it is recommended that you visit the "Playstation Datacenter" at
  http://psxdata.snesorama.us/. We want to thank Gladiator who has
  been a very important help in betatesting the new version.

ePSXe v1.6.0, released on 05.08.2003

- Fixed some cdrom emulation regressions, and more accurate cdrom emulation.
  Gran Turismo 2, Dance Dance Revolution series, Gear Fighter Deboh, 
  Hokuto no Ken, Gundam Battle Assault 2.

- Changes to cdrom emulation what does that modchips games works. 
  It includes Legend of Dragon US, Winning Eleven 2002, Um Jammer Lammy,
  Omega Boost JAP, Wild Arms 2nd Ignition JAP, Saga Frontier 2 JAP,
  Chocobo Racing JAP and possibly others.

- Added support for autopause when playing CDDA sound. It should fix the
  problems with music in games like Tomb Raider I.

- Added support for report mode when playing CDDA sound. It fixes 
  tekken 1 music and Lemmings 3D. (if you have problems with this change
  it can be disabled with the commandline -disablereportmode).

- Fixed some problems reading subchannel. (Harvest Moon)

- Minnor changes to change disc function. (Arc the lad 3)

- Now the memcards are autosaved on the fly. It should solve the
  problem of lost your memcards if the emulator crashes on gameplay.
  (Remember that it is a good idea, to backup your memcards sometimes)

- Added gun emulation using a mouse. (Time Crisis 1, 2)

- Now the mouse emulacion can be selected in the second gameport, anyway
  only 1 mouse is supported yet, so if you do enable it, it will be
  disabled in the first pad.

- It is possible now select analog, digital and disabled mode in every gamepad. 
  (Thanks to everybody who helped testing it :)

- Included multitap support. In this version only 1 multitap is 
  supported. If you select multitap, it will support 4 gamepads, what
  will be connected to the first gameport of the psx. Multitap only
  must be enabled in games what supports it, in the rest of the games
  will not work the gamepads if multitap is enabled.

- The keys F5 and F6 have in the new version a different function. F6 is
  used for select a pad, and F5 will toggles digital/analog mode in the 
  pad selected. (you need upgrade your gpu plugins to 1.73 or superior)

- The dos window what shows the info messages, can be enabled/disabled from GUI.

- Included support for CDI isos. (Discjuggler format)

- Fixes to the CD-Rom decoder and the core, which made some more games
  playable like, for example, Spyro 2 PAL, Spyro 3 PAL, Front Mission 3,
  Batman Gothan City Racer, Duke Nukem: Land of babes, Ridge Racer JAP,
  Nekketsu Oyako, Bust a Grove 2 JAP ...

ePSXe v1.5.2, released on xx.05.2002

- Fixed a bug which got into 1.5.2 regarding several gte flags 
  (Porsche Challenge, Tomb Raider).

- Partially rewrote the CD-Rom decoder, now it doesn't need custom flags 
  in order to run various games any more.

- Moved the subchannel read options to it's own window in the CD-Rom 
  configuration. Also added a new subchannel reading mode, which works 
  with various LG 852x cdrom drives.

- Fixed a bug in the internal SPU plugin, which has been there since v1.5.0! 
  It caused sound effects to repeat and several games to freeze 
  (BOF series, Soul Blade).

- Added support for the Nero ISO format (.nrg).

- Massive changes to the SIO emulation. It should have better timing now and 
  the F4 trick shouldn't be necessary that often any more. "SIO irq always on" 
  has been removed from the GUI, but you can still turn it on using the F4 
  key. (affects Silent Hill esp, Track & Field, Metalslugx, NFS5 PAL, Rapshody ...)

- Fixed a bug in the internal ISO reading routines, which prevented some of the 
  last sectors to be accessed.

- As the Chrono Cross trick isn't necessary any more, we have assigned a new 
  trick to the F7 key, for the Xenogears dreams sequence: Press this key at 
  the beginning of the scene, and once again after the end ;)

- Fixes to the CD-Rom decoder and the core, which made some more games 
  playable like, for example, Theards of Fate, NBA Basketball 2000, 
  Legend of Mana, Rebelt Assault 2, Tekken 2, MegamanX series, 
  Jackie Chan US, Michelin Rally Masters, Transformers Beast of Wars ...

ePSXe v1.5.1, released on xx.03.2002

- Included partial support for libcrypt games. Libcrypt is a protection
  scheme used very often in PAL games. It uses data in subchannel Q.
  In order to play your original cd games in ePSXe you need a cdrom reader
  which works with the read-subchannel routines in ePSXe. NOT every cdrom
  reader with support for read subchannels will work in epsxe. If your cdrom
  reader is able to read subchannels but it is not supported by ePSXe,
  you can use clonecd to read the subchannel to a .SUB file, and copy it
  in the epsxe\patches directory with the same name than cdrom PS-EXE
  and with the extension .SUB (SLESXXX.XX.SUB/SCESXXX.XX.SUB/SLUSXXX.XX.SUB..)
  Since reading from subchannel is slow, ePSXe includes an option in the
  cdrom config window that you can enable to cache the subchannel to disk
  the first time you run a game. Of course you can always use some external
  cdrom plugins, currently only Pete's cdrom plugin supports it.
  (The support is partial because NO every libcrypt game is working :(,
  the no working games includes (at least) Spyro 2 and 3 PAL, and
  formula one 99) 
 
  In resumen:

  1) If you want subchannel support only from files, select in the cdrom config 
     window "Enable subchannel support".

  2) If you want subchannel support from cdrom, select in the cdrom config window
     "Enable subchannel support" and 
     "Enable subchannel read from cdrom."
     If your cdrom is able to read subchannels in epsxe, a message will be
     shown in the console between the rest of init messages.

  3) If you want to caching to disk the subchannel the first time what you
     run a game, select in the cdrom config window:
     "Enable subchannel support", 
     "Enable subchannel read from cdrom." and
     "Enable subchannel caching to disk."

  4) If you have problems reading the cdroms after of select
     "Enable subchannel read from cdrom." probably your cdrom is not compatible
     with ePSXe subchannel read routines, disable this option, and make your
     own .sub files with CloneCD.

- Added support for Teac cdrom readers to internal cdrom plugins.
  (Thanks to Pete)

- Added support for pov hat joysticks.
  (Thanks to Roberto Paredes by multiples tests)

- Some CD stuff got fixed, like the problem with changing discs, the 
  internal win2k CD plugin CDDA problems and a bug with the ppf support of 
  the internal plugins.

- Fixes to the GTE, which solve problems with 102 Dalmatinas, Rugrats in
  paris, Destruction Derby 2, Nuclear Strike and possibly others.

- Changed some internal timing stuff, which should produce better (faster)
  background sound in several games (FF7, Threads of Fate, Valkyrie Profile)
  (You can use the old timing with -oldtiming)

- Removed the auto detection of game and required BIOS, as this prevented
  Legend of the dragoon US and Wild Arms 2 US from working.

- Removed the two options -cdinc and -nocdinc, as fixes made them 
  unncessary. In this version -noxaread has not some effect.

- Added support for MDEC transparency, for the Oddworld series, dw4/dw7 
  battle effects. 

- Added support for Capcom MDECs, but you need to use the command line
  -adjustiming, what will give serious problems with gamepad keys and
  memory cards (use F4 to fix this problems), and hard slowdowns.
  (Use this option in your own risk, we recommend to use it only when
  it will be really necessary).

- Included a new commandline, it is called -nocdoverwrite. It could fix
  problems with some games like Parappa the Rapper's demo. Sometimes
  it does the same than -cdtiming.

- LINUX version only: added partial support for external gamepad plugins.
  Actually only works the lamer0's plugin, what is combined with the
  internal pad plugin.

- Fixes to CPU and CD-Rom make games like Star Wars - The phantom Menace,
  Resident Evil 1 PAL, Legend of Legaia, Star Ocean 2, Gran Turismo JAP and
  Philisoma playable.

ePSXe v1.5.0, released on xx.01.2002

- Fixed a bug in MDECs, which caused Metal Gear Solid and Rayman 1 to 
  crash. Furthermore, the MDEC options aren't read from the windows 
  registry any more, so you can only disable them with command lines 
  from now on.

- Rewritten the code what loaded the ps-exe files when starting a game, for 
  a better detection of the games name and the region.

- Added native support for ppf files. Now you don't need to patch the games 
  any more, simply copy your ppf file into the directory "/patches", with 
  the same name than the main PS-exe file in the cdrom (SLES*,SCES*,
  SLUS* ...), in uppercase. ePSXe will load it on startup then and patch 
  the game in memory on the fly !

- MCI code is now disabled in WinNT/2k/XP, expect when you are using an 
  external CD-ROM plugin which has its own CDDA functions (e.g. Pete's). 
  Furthermore, the external CD-ROM plugins can now play some games like 
  Tomb Raider I and II PAL, what was not possible before due to a bug 
  in 1.4.0.

- Fixed a bug in the internal CD-ROM plugins, which caused some games to 
  hang when they played CDDA sound and later accessed a data 
  sector (Rayman 1)

- Fixed some bugs in savestates. New savestate are not compatibles with old 
  epsxe versions, but the savestates from a savestate from an old version 
  can still be loaded. The command line -ssv0 has been added, which 
  will let ePSXe save the savestates into the old (but buggy) format. 
  (Fixed savestates in square mdecs, and in threads of fate)

- Some games which ran only with a certain bios version, should now run 
  with any (only checked with Legend of Dragon PAL)

- Fixed some GTE bugs. (Looney Tunes: Perro y Lobo, Nhl 99)

- Included a file with help, what can be accessed from help->contents.
  (Thanks to Bobbi)

- Last hour changes in internal spu, what fixes Metal gear solid and
  Valkyrie profile sound, but we have not had too time for test it ;)

- Added a new workaround in order to run Parasite Eve 2 (thanks to 
  Psychojak!). You need to use the command "-pe2". Some PE2 versions are 
  automaticly detected and don't need it though. We didn't play through 
  the complete game though, we can't tell if it's playable until the end.

- Fixes to the CD-Rom decoder and the core, which make some more games 
  playable like for example Valkyrie profile, Syphon filter series speech, 
  Rayman 1, Micromachines V3, Croc 2, Duke Nukem: Land of Babes, Vrally 2 
  and Nfs 5 menus, Time Crisis 2 music, Casper Around the World ...

- Multiples games can be played using additional commands like: 
  Rebelt Assault 2 (-noignorecmd), Micromaniacs (-cdtiming), 
  Front Mission 3 (-nocdinc) ...

ePSXe v1.4.0, released on  xx.06.2001

- Included a new wizard guided config, what should do easier
  configure the emulator.

- Fixed a bug in the internal sound plugin which caused
  crash on systems using directx8+geforce and some soundcards.

- Fixed a division by zero bug in the gte routines that started
  in version 1.2.0. It solves the problems with Xenogears,
  Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy 7.

- Added the extension .img (clonecd) to the load iso function.

- Fixed a bug detecting the name of some games, it is used
  to detect the format (pal/ntsc). (Metal Gear Solid Pal)

- Fixed a bug in the function CDROpen. Fix the psemupro iso plugin.

- Added support to the cdplayer included in the playstation
  bios, you can listen to your cdda with epsxe now :)

- Fixed some problems with the bootstrap of the playstation.
  -nogui should not be needed anymore. (Destruction Derby Raw pal,
  Breath of fire 3)

- Fixed some gte problems. (Vandal hearts 2 pal, Wipeout series)

- Fixed a mdec decoder bug. (Xfiles)

- Added preliminary support for netplay plugins. (Cyberpad)

- Now it is possible to change the memcards file in any moment of the
  game. (Of course you shouldn't change the memcard while the
  game is writing it, like in a psx ;-)

- Fixed some problems with the change disc function. (Metal Gear Solid)

- Included support for a new feature included in the video plugins,
  it now shows a mini-picture from the savestates when you use the
  F2 key to increase the selected save slot. (It works only with
  savestates done with the version 1.4.0 or superior)

- Fixed some problems with the XA sound effects and background
  XA sound which fix Silent Bomber, Megaman X5, Castlevania SOTN,
  Bloody Roar 1, Dinocrisis 2, and more.

- Fixes to the CD-Rom decoder and the core, which make some more games
  playable like for example Incredible Crisis, Simpsons Wresting,
  Threads of fate, Tomb Raider I and II (pal),
  Fighting Force 2 and so on ;)

ePSXe v1.2.0, released on 07.03.2001

- Added better analogic pad emulation and force feedback.
  It is now possible to configure the analogic axis and
  the effect of the force feedback motors. (Many thanks
  to Alex7 and to www.burutter.com, for donating a very nice
  psx to usb pad converter and giving help on adding support
  for it).

- Now ePSXe includes savestates support. F1 = save state,
  F2 = increase slot (max = 5), F3 = load state. The
  savestates are compressed and saved to the sstates directory,
  with an average size of 1.5Mb.
  (WARNING!!! In release date it is supported only in the
  following plugins: Lewpy Gpu, Pete Gpu, Pete Spu and ePSXe Spu,
  support will be included in more plugins soon
  by the plugins authors)

- Partially re-writen the internal spu, it should be
  faster, have less sound glitches and better sound quality.

- Optimizations added in gte, mdec and core which makes
  some games work some fps faster than before.

- Fixes to the CD-Rom decoder and the core, which make some more games
  playable like for example Gran Turismo, Resident Evil, Ape Escape,
  Kingley Adventure, Legend of Legaia (use the "-legaia" command line),
  Final Fantasy IX PAL and so on ;-)

ePSXe v1.0.1, released on xx.xx.2000

- A completly re-written MDEC engine, which should give you better quality
  and some more FPS during video playback.
- More accurate timing, what means that videos should pause less. (MDEC
  timing should always be turned ON now)
- Included two new internal CD-Rom plugins : One for WinNT/Win2k users,
  which uses WinNT/Win2k's native functions, and an ASPI CD-Rom plugin
  for Win9x and Win2k users, which is usually faster than the older plugins.
- Fixes to XA sound playback in the internal SPU plugin.
- Included NTSC/PAL auto detection for a more accurate timing, mainly
  in Square videos.
- The ISOs are loaded directly now, without showing the BIOS logo. 
- Added support for PSX mouse emulation. (Selectable in Config -> Controller)(*)
- Added support for PSX analog pad emulation using Analog Pads or mouse.
  (selectable in Config- > Controller)(*)
- It's now possible to disable the pads; this is necessary for some games which
  are only playable for 1 player. (qbert)
- Included a new memory card selector, which comes with support for the most
  important memory card formats (.MCR, .MEM, .MCD, .GME)
- Memory cards are saved now when you go to the main window and when you exit
  the emu incorrectly. It's still highly recommended though to close down the
  emu using the File -> Exit option ;-)
- Added an experimental "Change discs" option. To switch a disc, you need to
  go to File -> Change disc. (this isn't working with some games yet though)
- ePSXe should work better with Lewpy's plugins now, so no more crashes when
  you exit the emu. The reset/continue functions should also work now on several
  videoboards.
- Fixes to the CD-Rom decoder and the core, which make some more games playable
  like for example Final Fantasy 9, Grandia, Fear Effect, Tenchu 2 and so on ;-)
- Added a snapshot maker in key F8. (you need the "snap" directory).
- Since we haven't been able to fix the Chrono Cross bug yet, we added a workaround,
  which can be activated using the F3 key while the game freezes at that point 
  (though this doesn't fix the status screen problem yet, you must still use the
  cheat code for this)


(*) We have created a system, where you can either use one digital pad and one
mouse or one analog pad. You can change between those using the F5 key.
We contacted the GPU plugin authors, so in the next version of their plugins, there 
should be a flag displaying the type of pad you have currently selected.

3.4. Configuring the emulator.

Basically you need to configure the bios, your video card, CD-ROm drive and
your sound card in order to get the emulator fully working.

3.4.1. Configuring the bios.

In ePSXe, click config -> bios. In the new window, you can see a text box 
which shows the currently selected bios and a browse button. Click this button
and select the BIOS you want to use. During testing we found out that the 
scph1001.bin and scph7502.bin BIOS' are compatible, but the scph1000.bin won't
work. Please remember you may only be in possession of the copyrighted BIOS 
when you're legally entitled.

3.4.2. Configuring the video options.

In ePSXe, click config -> video. In the new window, you can see a dropdown menu
which shows the currently selected video plugin(*). Select your favourite video 
plugin and click on the configure button, and, finally click ok.

(*) EPSXE uses PSEmu Pro's video plugins, so in order to use ePSXe, you need to 
download them from their webpages first.

3.4.3. Configuring the CD-Rom

in ePSXe, select config -> cdrom. In the new window, you can see a dropdown menu
which shows the currently selected CD-Rom plugin(*). Select the plugin of your
choise and click on the "Configure" button afterwards. There's yet another dropdown
menu, in which you can select the drive letter of the CD-Rom you want to use. In case
you want to use your primary CD-Rom, just stay with the default entry. For using
another CD-Rom, just select the preferred drive and click on OK. We mainly tested
the emulator with the internal cdrom plugins, and with the Pete cdrom plugin.

Win2k users should use the new win2k native CDR plugin, it worked fine
during our tests.

3.4.4. Configuring the sound.

In ePSXe, select config -> sound. In the new window, you can see a dropdown menu
which shows the currently selected sound plugin(*). Select the sound plugin of
your choise and click on the "Configure" button afterwards. In the appearing
window, there're several check boxes where you can enable disable certain
sound options. The playstation uses 3 different kind of sounds : ADPCM, XA
and CDDA.

* Enable Sound  (Select this to enable ADPCM sound) - Used to enable ADPCM
sound, and it is necessary to get XA sound.

(*) EPSXE can use PSEmu Pro's sound plugin system or an internal
    sound system. If you want to use psemu plugins you need download the
    plugins first. Recommeded are Pete, Eternal and the internal one.
    There is other very good like Andy and Iori plugins.

3.4.5. Choosing MemoryCards files.

In this window, you can select the memory cards files what you want to use.
ePSXe supports the most important memory cards formats, .MC(R), .GME, .MCD
and .MEM.

3.5. Command line options.

                                 all files included in a .zip

3.6. Emulator patches.

Some games, which normally wouldn't run in ePSXe, will start when using
cheat codes. Patches for several games are already included in the
emulator ! To select them, click on "Cheats" in ePSXe, load the game
patch you need and enjoy ;-)

This function shouldn't be used to cheat in games, we recommend you to
use [pec] (http://pec.emucheater.com) for in game cheating.

3.7. Memory cards support.

ePSXe also comes along with memory card support. The used cards are saved
in 2 files in your \memcards directory. The first one is named epsxe000.mcr 
and the second one epsxe001.mcr. Each file has a size of 128 KB (which is
PSX standard), and the format is simply a dump of real memory cards.

ePSXe doesn't come with a memory card editor, but you can use the option
Load -> Run BIOS to get to the real PSX memory card editor, from where
you can delete / move savegames. In case you're using Pete's OpenGL / D3D
plugins, don't forget to enable offscreen rendering to see this menu 
correctly.

ePSXe 1.0.1 includes a memory card file selector, so you can select which file
you want to use in which slot. ePSXe also has support for different memory card
file supports, like Dexdrive (.gme), PSEmu Pro (.mc) and several others.

3.8. Savestates.

ePSXe 1.2.0 supports savestates. They are files that
contain the state of the emulator when the key was hit, so you
can restore to the state later in that same exact point.

F1 = Save the state to the slot selected
F2 = Increase the slot. (If you use the on fly menus
in gpu plugins you can see the slot selected)
(MAX = 5 slots)
F3 = Load the state of the slot selected

ePSXe 1.2.0, 1.4.0 supports savestates version 0.
ePSXe >=1.5.0      supports savestates version 0 and 1.

3.9. Netplay plugins.

ePSXe 1.4.0 supports netplay plugins. To select the plugin
you should use the option config->netplay. Read the
docs included in the netplugin pack.

5.  Compatibility in EPSXE
*******************************************************************************

Compatibility in ePSXe hasn't been tested that much yet, actually it has been
mainly tested with PAL games. Current compatibility percentage is superior
at 95%.

Some games known to work are:

- Colin McRae Rally 1 and 2
- Crash Bandicoot 1, 2 and 3
- Driver 1 and 2
- Fifa 99/2000.
- Final Fantasy VII, VIII and IX
- Iss98, Isspro evolution
- Knockout Kings 99, 2000
- NBA Live 2000, and 2001
- Need For Speed III, IV, V
- Ridge Racer
- Ridge Racer type 4
- Soulblade
- Syphon Filter 1, 2
- Tekken 1, 2 and 3
- Tigger Woods 99, 2000
- Tomb Raider 1, 2, 3 and 4
- Vagrant Story
- and many more ...

Once you start a game in ePSXe various things can occur:

   - The game works correctly.
       Solution: "Be happy !" :) Send us a screenshot when you're
       through the game.

   - The game works but you get graphics problems.
       Solution : ePSXe uses the PSEmu Pro plugins to draw the graphics to
       your screen, so you could try a different plugin.

   - The game works but you get 3d graphics or light problems.
       Solution:  ePSXe has a more or less complete GTE emulation, but
       several GTE opcodes are still very buggy :-(. Wait for the  next
       version. You can also try another plugin to make sure it's really
       a GTE problem (Pete's soft GPU plugin is very very compatible !)

   - The GAME still won't work.
       Solution:  If, after all, the game STILL won't work, than it's most
       propably simply not compatible with ePSXe right now. You should wait
       for the next version of the emulator. 

Sound.

   ePSXe comes with support for the PSEmu Pro sound plugins in this version.
   This includes ADPCM, CDDA and partial XA sound.  Common problems
   with the sound:

   - The game plays no sound at all
       Solution: Check the sound settings in the menu.

   - XA sound playback is jerky.
       Solution: You need 50/60 fps in order to get accurate sound.

6. Where can I get help with the emulator?
******************************************************************************

There are a number of ways to receive help. The first thing you should do is
read the documentation, since the majority of questions are already
answered in it. Also, you can use the following emulation newsgroups :

news://comp.emulator.misc
news://comp.emulator.game.consoles

Another way is to ask on an emulator related IRC channel, like #epsxe, #psxemu
or #emu in EFNET (get mIRC from http://www.mirc.com to connect)
Many people you'll meet there will know more than we do about fixing certain
problems that you may experience with this emulator, or they'll be able to
point you somewhere where you can find a solution for your problem.

This software is freeware, and we don't have a lot of time to answer
questions, but if any of the above methods fail, you can try to contact
us using the following ways, but don't always expect a reply from us !
